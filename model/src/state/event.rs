/// An event represents an update to the domain of a variable.
/// It is typically stored in a trail an provides:
///
/// - the affected variable bound, e.g., lb(x3)
/// - the previous value of the bound. This allows backtracking by undoing the change.
///   The `previous` field also provides the index of the event that set the previous value, to support efficiently
///   scanning the trail.
/// - the new value of the bound. This is available directly in the trail to allow efficiently scanning the trail
///   for the latest changes.
/// - the cause of this event, which can be used for computing explanations.
